## Who are we?

We are Mikey O'Toole ([@homotechsual](https://github.com/homotechsual) and Luke Whitelock ([@LWhitelock](https://github.com/lwhitelock)) we are both directors for (separate) UK-based managed IT services providers who share a passion for automation and good quality MSP software tools.

## What is this?

This is the code for a [PowerShell](https://microsoft.com/powershell) module for the [Halo Service Solutions](https://haloservicesolutions.com/) series of software, including:

* [HaloPSA](https://halopsa.com)
* [HaloISTM](https://haloitsm.com/)
* [HaloServiceDesk](https://haloservicedesk.com/)

The module is written for [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-71?view=powershell-7.1). **It is not compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and never will be.**. This module is licensed under the [MIT](https://haloapi.mit-license.org/) license.

## What does it do?

HaloAPI provides a PowerShell wrapper around the Halo API, tested extensively against HaloPSA instances only (please test against HaloISM or HaloServiceDesk instances and let us know how it works). The module can retrieve and send information to the Halo API.
